Hi! I am Jarvis. I'm a direct Ph.D. student in School of Computer Science and Engineering, Beihang University.

I have been working under the supervision of [Prof. Jingyuan Wang](https://www.bigscity.com/jingyuan-wang/) at [BIGSCITY Lab](https://www.bigscity.com/)since 2021 fall. Now I am a Joint-PhD student in the Joint PhD programme offerd by City University of Hong Kong(**CityU**) and Beihang University(**BUAA**).
And I will go to CityU to continue my research under the advisory of [Dr. Xiangyu Zhao](https://zhaoxyai.github.io/).

My research interests mainly focus on spatio-temporal data mining and urban computing.
